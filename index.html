            <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: center;">By Elijah Nicholson-Messmer</p>
            <p>When Alexandra Stephanou and her partner started looking for a new apartment back in February, &lsquo;rent bidding&rsquo; was an unfamiliar concept to the two. By the end of their search, it was a $1,200 reality.</p>
            <p>After living in the same North End apartment since moving to Boston in May of 2020, Stephanou enlisted the help of a Compass real estate broker to ease the process of looking for a new apartment. Quickly, the agent&rsquo;s assistance proved to be a point of stress itself.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;She was very aggressive with [saying], &lsquo;Well, if you like it, you have to apply now,&rsquo;&rdquo; Stephanou said. &ldquo;And mind you, this is early March and we&rsquo;re trying to rent a September 1 unit. She created an environment of a lot of pressure, like &lsquo;There is going to be rent bidding, are you prepared for that?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Despite the pressure from her broker, Stephanou was not rushing to apply for any of the poorly maintained, often dirty apartments she toured, let alone bid on them. Then she saw an apartment — <i>the apartment</i> — pop up on Zillow.</p>
            <p>The broker, Scott Haines, responded, telling her there was a tour scheduled the next morning. There is a lot of interest, he said, so make sure to arrive on time. Saturday morning, Stephanou arrived right on the scheduled time, only to see “12 people with different brokers walking through the apartment.”</p>
            <p>As soon as Stephanou stepped into the apartment with Haines, she knew she wanted to apply.</p>
            <p>“He gave us the information and told us to run home and apply,” she said. “So that&rsquo;s what we did. We shuffled home really quickly, got all the paperwork done in a frenzy, and then in the span of just a few hours, he was able to say that our application was approved.”</p>
            <p>Then came the bid.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 offset-lg-3">
            <p class="message-container sender">He just called. He received an application along with ours and they&rsquo;re offering $3,500, $100 more than the asking price. He prefers to go with you, but wanted to see if you&rsquo;ll take it for $3,500.</p>
            <p class="message-container receiver">Thanks for the transparency. If we do $3,500 would that definitely include the parking spot? We&rsquo;re happy to match that offer.</p>
            <p class="message-container sender">“Parking is $100 [extra] per month. I would do two tandem spots for $150 a month. Pet fee is $50 per month”</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 offset-lg-3">
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Stephanou called Haines: “Are you bullshitting us? Did somebody really put that on an application?”</p>
            <p>“It&rsquo;s pretty common,” Haines told her.</p>
            <p>Reluctantly, Stephanou and her partner agreed to match the other applicant&rsquo;s offer. The one-bedroom, already listed for $3,400, was about to get even more expensive. All in, they paid $250 over the asking price, with a $100 bid, a $100 parking spot, and a $50 pet fee. Over their 12-month lease, that equates to $3,000 in unexpected expenses.</p>
            <p>“I sympathize with renters and give them a lot of credit for putting up with the rental market, but what can be done?” Haines said in a statement. “It&rsquo;s simply capitalism, money talks.”</p>

            <h3>A costly recovery</h3>
            <p>Brokers point to a variety of factors behind the emerging issue, including rising interest rates forcing would-be home buyers back to the rental market, a return to office push from employers, and a sub-1% vacancy rate across the greater Boston area.</p>
            <p>devin michelle bunten, an assistant professor in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT, said that housing shortages, whether in home sales or apartment rentals, are at the root of hyper-competitive markets like Boston&rsquo;s.</p>
            <p>After Boston&rsquo;s vacancy rate hit a multi-year high of nearly 8% in September 2020, the number of available rentals has rapidly declined across the city, driving the current vacancy rate to below pre-pandemic numbers.</p>
            <p>The city&rsquo;s tight rental market leaves many renters lining up, often literally, for a limited number of units. </p>
            <p>"One way that higher-income individuals, or, in some cases, lower-income individuals with roommates, or who are just taking on a severe rent burden try to jump that line is by offering above the asking price," she said.</p>
            <p>The emerging phenomenon is a boon for landlords, some of whom may be using rent bidding to make up for lost revenue from the state&rsquo;s six-month eviction moratorium instituted in 2020, Doucette said.</p>
            <p>Rather than simply increasing rent prices in unit listings, landlords may use rent bidding as a tool to learn just how much they can charge for an apartment in the current market, bunten said. "This is a way to further turn the shortage to the advantage of the landlords by enabling them to use their power to extract that information from tenants, like, just how much can they get away with charging," she said.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 offset-lg-3">
            <p>Rent bidding is not the only tactic Boston renters have used to try and get an edge in a competitive market. One renter said that while she did not bid on the rent price itself, she did offer her broker $500 in cash on top of the standard broker fee to secure an apartment.</p>
            <p>A Somerville resident said that, on top of offering an extra $150 a month on the listed rent price, she also created 'rental resumes' for her and her roommates, detailing references, hobbies, and job experience to strengthen their application at her broker's suggestion.</p>
            <p>Even high-earners like Stephanou and her partner have tried signing longer, 18-month lease agreements to escape a bidding war.</p>
            <p>“The whole experience just made us feel really fortunate that we have that type of income to pay for a place like this, as well as really discouraged about the housing market,” Stephanou said. “I don't know how people afford to live here who don't have high-paying jobs. I don't understand how families or low-income families do it.”</p>

                    <p>In Allston, a quarter of all apartments were bid up from their initial list price. Data shows that the neighborhood&rsquo;s popularity among <span style="background-color: #69907f;">university students</span> may be partially to blame for the high rate of rent bidding.</p>

                    <p>There is a consistent pattern across Boston ZIP Codes: areas with more students also tend to have higher rates of rent bidding.</p>

                    <p><span style="background-color: #16457f;">Undergraduate students</span> are a big contributor to that pattern.

                <div class="part" id="part5">
                    <p>That pattern is particularly strong when it comes to <span style="background-color: #ff6224;">graduate students</span>, who are responsible for 37% of the rent bidding variance in a given ZIP Code.

It's mostly this September 1st student rush,” she said. “It's just very competitive. And it seems like they're willing to pay whatever it takes just to get into the apartment.”</p>

            <h3>The rent eats first</h3>
            <p>Neighborhoods with large Black and Latino populations like Roxbury and Dorchester have some of the most severe rent bidding in the greater Boston area. Bidding wars don&rsquo;t pop up as frequently in these neighborhoods compared to the rest of the city, but when they do renters end up paying 7% to 8% above the list price on average — amounting to thousands of dollars a year in additional rent costs.</p>
            <p>For Black and Latino residents, who are already disproportionally rent-burdened, keeping up with such bidding wars may push them to even more severe degrees of rent burden.</p>

            <h3>The regulatory landscape</h3>
            <p>Real estate brokers are not prohibited by any regulations from participating in rent bidding, according to the Board of Registration of Real Estate Brokers and Salespersons.</p>
            <p>Some brokerage agencies have internal policies that prevent bidding wars from happening in the first place. But, for such policies to work a landlord has to offer an “exclusive” listing, where they choose to list their rental with only one agency. But, it&rsquo;s unknown how common such exclusive listings are.</p>
            <p>Even for Scott Hanes — whose brokerage&rsquo;s internal policy does not allow for rent bidding — the majority of rentals he works with are “open,” meaning that multiple brokerages have access to advertise and rent out the apartment.</p>
            <p>“When my clients are interested in an apartment that's exclusive to another brokerage, especially if there's an open house, I tell them that there are apartments out there that rent for a price higher than asking,” Hanes said. “I'm the source of the information and it's up to them to make a decision. I work in the best interest of my clients and we've been successful at times with this bidding war, but we've also missed out on some.”</p>
            <p>Under the current regulatory landscape, whether or not a bidding war happens is ultimately up to the landlord of the rental property, according to Sarah Doucette.</p>
            <p>The lack of regulation is unsurprising given the phenomenon&rsquo;s nascent state in Boston. But, brokers like Doucette would like to see legislation passed that bans the practice.</p>
            <p>“The rents are one price advertised and that's really what it should be,” Doucette said. “You know, you have somebody with a certain budget and then you have to really go into it telling them it's going to be $100 to $200 over.”</p>
            <p>Exactly what that regulation would look like for Boston is unclear, but countries like Australia offer some potential approaches.</p>

            <h3>The new rules</h3>
            <p>As Boston's supply of housing trails behind demand, it is unclear if rent bidding will continue into the future.</p>
            <p>Housing shortages turn the rental market into a game of musical chairs, bunten said. Historically, the people who were able to secure a seat, so to speak, were those who submitted their applications the quickest, assuming they met the landlord's qualifications.</p>
            <p>Rent bidding may be changing that.</p>
            <p>"Now, it's simply asking tenants to pay more to get a seat," bunten said. "And, in any case, there's a bunch of folks who are not gonna be able to sit down, and who are not going to be able to find housing in Boston, or at least in the areas that they want to live, or that they've been living, [where] their social lives and their cultural lives are built around."</p>
